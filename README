MBW determines the "copy" memory bandwidth available to userspace programs. Its simplistic approach models that of real applications. It is not tuned to extremes and it is not aware of hardware architecture, just like your average software package.

This is the fork of original raas/mbw project (https://github.com/raas/mbw)

Features I'd added:

    * Added ability to run several threads simulatenoulsly
    * Better output control

'mwb -t 4 512' to run 4 threads simulatenously
'mbw 1000' to run copy memory test on all methods with 1 GiB memory.
'mbw -h' for help

watch out for swap usage (or turn off swap)
